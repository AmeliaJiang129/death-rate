    "text": "1 Introduction\nWell-being of people is the pursuit of all governments and non-profit organizations, so in the past decades, we have experienced a huge improvement in living standards. While the death rate and life expectancy are two of the most important measures of well-being, we are interested in exploring how societal and economic development have affected death rates and life expectancy at birth over time. Using Global Health Estimates (GHE) life tables released by the World Health Organization (WHO), we want to explore the trend of death rate and life expectancy globally, compare and contrast between regions over the world, and also look at the variations from age, sex and age groups.\nBuilding upon the general trend of death rate, we are interested in diving in to explore the breakdown of death causes, which can reflect well being of people and society conditions. For example, disease can be a huge portion of all death cases in the past when we did not have an established health care system or effective disease prevention practices and treatments. Using GHE leading causes of death database, we want to understand the composition of death cases and variations across continents, countries, age groups, and genders.\nIntended Research Questions:\n\nHow has the death rate and life expectancy changed over time, globally and regionally?\nDoes death rate and life expectancy differ by sex?\nDo more developed regions have lower death rate, higher life expectancy and larger changes than undeveloped regions?\nDo more developed regions have a more left skewed distribution of death rate on age?\nWhat causes death globally and regionally?\nDoes the composition of causes of death change over time?\nAre there any interaction effects between variables such as age and sex affect the causes of death?\nHow do the causes of death differ and appear to be similar across regions, and is this associated with development level?\n\nOverall, we will answer trends of death rate, life expectancy, and the causes of death globally and regionally from multiple dimensions and perspectives."

    "text": "2.1 Technical description\n\n2.1.1 Data Source 1:\nThis dataset is collected and published by the World Health Organization. WHO collects time series of death registration data from as early as the 1950s for around 100 countries. This specific table publishes annual period life tables for years 2000-2019.\nThe dataset can be downloaded as .cvs file and excel file. We chose the .cvs format for easier importing. It has 9310 rows and 34 columns. Among all Indicators in column 2, we are only interested in life expectancy and death rate, so we will only keep rows of these two indicators (ex - expectation of life at age x and nMx: age-specific death rate between ages x and x+n) and drop others. Looking at the columns, there are many duplicated items, such as value and the corresponding value code, and some redundant items such as variable type. Hence, we will only keep the following informative columns: Indicator, Location, Period (year), Dim1 (sex), Dim2 (age group), FactValueNumeric for analysis purpose. After the data cleaning, our dataset has 2660 rows and 6 rows.\nIndicator contains two values: ex - expectation of life at age x and nMx: age-specific death rate between ages x and x+n, which are the indicators we are interested in analyzing. Location contains Global, Africa, Americans, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, and Western Pacific. Period stores year of the observation. Dim1 is sex, which contains Male and Female. Dim2 represent age groups, which has value from &lt;1 year to 85+ years, with the interval of 5. FactValueNumeric is the value for indicators, which is in numeric format.\n\n\n2.1.2 Data Source 2: GHE: Leading causes of death\nWHO’s Global Health Estimates (GHE) provide the latest available data on causes of death globally, by region and country, and by age, sex and income group. They provide key insights on mortality and morbidity trends to support informed decision-making on health policy and resource allocation.\nThese estimates are produced using data from multiple sources, including national vital registration data, latest estimates from WHO technical programmes, United Nations partners and inter-agency groups, as well as the Global Burden of Disease and other scientific studies. Before publishing, the GHE are reviewed by WHO Member States through consultation with national focal points and WHO country and regional offices.\nThe update intervals of this database are not strictly uniform. The specific time panels it includes are: 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2019. It can be exported directly in xlsx format from the website. The main feature columns include: Age Group, Sex Group, Time, Region, and Cause Category. This table records the number of deaths attributed to various causes. It consists of 4 (# of time period) \\(\\times\\) 6 (# of regions) sheets, each containing a 215-row (# of causes) \\(\\times\\) 16-column (# of gender-age subgroups) dataset table.\nThis dataset is an aggregate table of death counts, meaning that the recorded data is aggregated across different categorical dimensions rather than representing the raw records of individual deaths. This indicates that the only numeric variable is the death count; all others are categorical variables. This implies that it will assist us in grouping data by different categories, facilitating the exploration of a comprehensible and insightful analysis of global health disparities, and allowing for targeted interventions in key areas.\nPlease note that the divisions of age, time, gender and region, which are categorical variables with the same meanings, are consistent across both data tables. This ensures that we can obtain research outcomes based on a uniform standard."

So the death rate will be low when age is young, and higher when age is large.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Data Source 2: GHE: Leading causes of death\nOur research on data source 2 involves the following parts:\n\n2.2.2.1 a. Temporal Analysis\n\nFor this part, we will examine temporal trends in causes of death over the past decade and identify regions or demographic groups experiencing significant changes in mortality rates.\nQuestions to be answered: Does the composition of causes of death change over time?\nMethods to be implemented: line chart, Cleveland dot plot.\n\n\n\n2.2.2.2 b. Regional, Age and Gender Disparities\n\nAnalyze causes of death by continent, age groups and gender groups, emphasizing descriptive statistics to highlight regional variations. We will explore the influence of socio-economic factors on mortality rates and highlight any discernible patterns or disparities in mortality rates.\nQuestions to be answered: What causes death globally and regionally? How do the causes of death differ and appear to be similar across regions, and is this associated with development level? Are there any interaction effects between variables such as age and sex affect the causes of death?\nMethods to be implemented: stacked bar chart for different categories, faceted geographic graphs, PCA analysis with biplot, Interaction effect analysis with Mosaic plot.\n\nBy employing EDA and simple statistical tests, this research aims to offer a comprehensible and insightful analysis of global health disparities. The findings from this study can inform targeted public health strategies and contribute to ongoing efforts to improve health outcomes on a global scale."

For example, the first level of causes includes three: (1) Communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions, (2) Noncommunicable diseases, and (3) Injuries. The first-level causes can be expanded into multiple secondary causes. For example, Communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions includes Infectious and parasitic diseases, Respiratory Infectious, and so on. By analogy, secondary causes include multiple 3rd-level causes, and 3rd-level causes include 4th-level causes, which are likely to be very rare fatal diseases.\nBased on this categorization, it can be assumed that the number of deaths due to the 1st-level causes is unlikely to be zero, as this is a very broad cause of death, with many categories underneath it. However, for a given 4th-level cause, there are likely to be multiple values of 0. For example, the number of deaths due to Trachoma is zero over the time period 2000 to 2019, and even if the range extends to global.\nSubject to the availability of data, when the number of deaths under a particular category is zero, it may be due to the fact that the official data do not capture this category of deaths, or it may be that there are indeed no deaths due to such causes. Here, we assume that our data sources are accurate, i.e., we believe the latter, and that there are indeed no deceased under this category. In this case, at this point, if the death_count is zero, it does not mean that the data is missing. Nevertheless, to account for this pattern in our dataset, we still counted the number of counts that were zero. That is, based on our assumptions, we converted the missing value analysis to an analysis of counts within subgroups that are zero.\nWe plot the trend of a gradually increasing proportion of zeros as we move deeper into the level hierarchy in the figure below:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf2 &lt;- read_excel(\"ghecode2019.xlsx\", sheet = \"Summary\",col_names = TRUE)\n\ndf_long &lt;- pivot_longer(df2,cols = Global:WPR, names_to = \"region\", values_to = \"death_num\")\n\nfiltered_data &lt;- df_long %&gt;%\n  filter(region != \"Global\")\n\nfiltered_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(if_zero = ifelse(death_num == 0, 'zero', 'non-zero'))\n\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = if_zero)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"count\",fill='cornflowerblue') +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Zero and Non-Zero Proportions on Different Levels of Death Cause Category\",\n    x = \"If Zero\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  )+\n  facet_wrap(~level,scales = \"free_y\")+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in this figure, although we used stat = “count” in the bar plot, we adjusted the scale of the y-axis to be free, to clearly compare zero and non-zero proportions. And it’s clear that as our we move deeper into the level hierarchy, the proportion of non-zeros is showing an increasing trend.\n\n\nCode\nfile_path &lt;- \"ghecode2019_1.xlsx\"\ndf_2019 &lt;- data.frame()\nfor (sheet_name in excel_sheets(file_path)) {\n  current_sheet &lt;- read_excel(file_path, sheet = sheet_name)\n  df_2019 &lt;- bind_rows(df_2019, current_sheet)\n}\n\ndf_2019_long &lt;- pivot_longer(df_2019,cols = '0-28 days':'70+ years', names_to = \"age_group\", values_to = \"death_num\")\n\ndf_2019_long$age_group &lt;- factor(df_2019_long$age_group, levels = c(\"0-28 days\", \"1-59 months\", \"5-14 years\", \"15-29 years\", \"30-49 years\", \"50-59 years\", \"60-69 years\",\"70+ years\"))\n\nggplot(df_2019_long, aes(x = region, y = death_num, fill = age_group)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\",) +\n  labs(title = \"Death Count in Different Age and Regions for 2019\",\n       x = \"Region\",\n       y = \"Death Count\",\n       fill = \"Age Group\")+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first graph above, we plotted grouped bars according to different regions. And the bars are stacked by counts in different age groups. Notice that although in some subgroups, the counts within the group are very small, they are not zero.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df_2019_long, aes(x = region, y = death_num, fill = age_group)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\",position = \"dodge\") +\n  facet_grid(. ~ sex) +\n\n  labs(title = \"Death Count in Different Age, Sex and Regions for 2019\",\n\n       x = \"Region\",\n       y = \"Death Count\",\n       fill = \"Age Group\")+\n  scale_y_log10() +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  coord_flip()\n\n\nWarning: Transformation introduced infinite values in continuous y-axis\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the second graph above, we plot the statistics of deaths in subgroups that distinguish between gender and age in each region, using 2019 data as an example. Notice that at this level of disaggregation, there are still no subgroups with zero counts.\nAs we can tell from the above graphs, there are indeed some very fine-faceted subgroups that have zero counts of death. For example, if we wanted to look at the number of females under the age of 5 who died in 2019 in Europe because of some rare 4th-level cause, it is possible that this value to be zero. However, at a more macro level of aggregation, the number of death counts within groups is not zero. This suggests that the data source we use is sufficient to allow us to identify some interesting trends, and in turn to draw some solid conclusions, on groups that are not faceted as that fine."

It is noted that there is an upward trend in the number of deaths globally. In particular, deaths from non-communicable diseases are the main source of the rise in the number of deaths from all factors, while deaths from communicable diseases and problems such as malnutrition show a downward trend. The death number of injuries is relatively stable and hardly changes over time.\n\n\nCode\ndf_2_long_1&lt;-df_2_long %&gt;%\n  filter(level == 1)\ndf_2_long_1$year &lt;-factor(df_2_long_1$year, levels = c(\"2019\",\"2015\", \"2010\",\"2000\"))\ndf_2_long_1$region &lt;-factor(df_2_long_1$region, levels = c(\"Wpr\",\"Sear\",\"Eur\",'Afr','Amr','Emr'))\ndf_2_long_1$cause &lt;-factor(df_2_long_1$cause, levels = c(\"Injuries\",\"Communicable & Nutritional\",\"Noncommunicable\"))\n\nggplot(df_2_long_1,aes(x = year, y = death_num, fill = cause)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Paired\") +\n  labs(title = \"Trends in Death Number Vary by Region, with Different Main Causes\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Death Num\") +\n  facet_wrap(~region, ncol = 1)+\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the labels above, Afr is short for African Region, Amr is short for Region of the Americas, Sear is short for South-East Asia Region, Eur is short for European Region, Emr is short for Eastern Mediterranean Region, and Wpr is short for Western Pacific Region. We will also use these abbreviations in the following analysis.\nIn terms of specific regions, Wpr and Sear had the highest number of deaths, while Amr and Emr had the lowest. In terms of changes in the number of deaths by region, Wpr, Emr and Amr show an upward trend, Afr shows a downward trend, and Sear and Eur remain more or less unchanged. For Wpr, Emr and Amr, where the number of deaths increased, noncommunicable disease was the most important source of increase. For Afr, where the overall number of deaths has declined, it is noted that a significant decline in deaths due to infectious diseases and malnutrition is the main reason for the overall decline, which even outweighs the rise in noncommunicable factors, resulting in a downward trend in the overall number of deaths.\n\n\nCode\ndf_2_long_1&lt;-df_2_long %&gt;%\n  filter(level == 1)\ndf_2_long_1$year &lt;-factor(df_2_long_1$year, levels = c(\"2019\",\"2015\", \"2010\",\"2000\"))\ndf_2_long_1$region &lt;-factor(df_2_long_1$region, levels = c(\"Wpr\",\"Sear\",\"Eur\",'Afr','Amr','Emr'))\ndf_2_long_1$cause &lt;-factor(df_2_long_1$cause, levels = c(\"Injuries\",\"Communicable & Nutritional\",\"Noncommunicable\"))\n\nggplot(df_2_long_1,aes(x = year, y = death_num, fill = cause)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Paired\") +\n  labs(title = \"Trends in Death Number Faceted on Sex\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Death Num\") +\n  facet_wrap(~sex, ncol = 1)+\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nBy gender, the overall number of deaths is higher for males than for females, and both show an upward trend over time. It is noted that for both gender groups, the number of deaths from noncommunicable disease is increasing, and the number of deaths from both communicable and nutritional causes is decreasing. It is also noteworthy that there are significantly more deaths from injuries and noncommunicable disease among males than females.\n\n\n3.2.2 A More Nuanced Division of Causes\nBelow, we will analyze the causes of death more specifically. In the above analysis, we simply categorized the causes of death into three main categories-communicable & nutritional, noncommunicable, and injuries-and now we will break them down more closely to find the major causes of death in each category.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter all the 2nd-level causes\nfiltered_data &lt;- df_2_long %&gt;%\n  filter(nchar(code) == 2)\n\nfiltered_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(father_cause = case_when(\n    substr(code, 1, 1) == \"1\" ~ 'Communicable & Nutritional',\n    substr(code, 1, 1) == \"2\" ~ df_2_long$cause[df_2_long$code == \"2\"][1],\n    substr(code, 1, 1) == \"3\" ~ df_2_long$cause[df_2_long$code == \"3\"][1],\n  ))\n\nfiltered_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(age_group2 = case_when(\n    age_group %in% c(\"0-28 days\", \"1-59 months\", \"5-14 years\", \"15-29 years\") ~ \"&lt;30 years\",\n    age_group %in% c(\"30-49 years\") ~ \"30-49 years\",\n    age_group %in% c(\"50-59 years\", \"60-69 years\") ~ \"50-69 years\",\n    TRUE ~ \"70+ years\"\n  ))\n\nfiltered_data$father_cause &lt;-factor(filtered_data$father_cause, levels = c(\"Noncommunicable\",\"Communicable & Nutritional\",\"Injuries\"))\n\nlibrary(lattice)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'lattice'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:openintro':\n\n    ethanol, lsegments\n\n\nCode\nfiltered_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(cause,age_group2) %&gt;%\n  mutate(death_sum = sum(death_num)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot( aes(x = reorder(cause, death_sum), y = death_sum, color = age_group2)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = 0), size = 2.5 )+\n  facet_grid(father_cause ~ ., scales = \"free_y\",space = \"free_y\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_log10()+\n  labs(title = \"Cleveland Dotplot - Main 2nd-level Causes and Differences on Age Groups\",\n       x = \"Cause\",\n       y = \"Death Number\",\n       color = \"Age Group\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 0.5,size=9))\n\n\nWarning: Transformation introduced infinite values in continuous y-axis\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong noncommunicable diseases, Cardiovascular diseases, Malignant neoplasms and Respiratory diseases are the top 3 causes for death. Among communicable & nutritional reasons, Infectious and parasitic diseases, Neonatal conditions and Respiratory Infectious are the top 3 causes for death. For injuries, unintentional injuries account for a higher proportion of deaths than intentional injuries.\nAlso note that the percentage of age in the different factors varies, an observation that is the same as the mosaic plot findings above.\n\n\nCode\nfiltered_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(cause,region) %&gt;%\n  mutate(death_sum = sum(death_num)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot( aes(x = reorder(cause, death_sum), y = death_sum, color = region)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = 0), size = 2.5 )+\n  facet_grid(father_cause ~ ., scales = \"free_y\",space = \"free_y\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_log10()+\n  labs(title = \"Cleveland Dotplot - Main 2nd-level Causes and Differences on Regions\",\n       x = \"Cause\",\n       y = \"Death Number\",\n       color = \"Region\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 0.5,size=9))\n\n\nWarning: Transformation introduced infinite values in continuous y-axis\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the differences in the regional distribution of the different factors, it is noted that Sear, Eur and Wpr contribute the highest number of deaths in noncommunicable causes, while Afr and Sear have a larger share of the dead in communicable as well as nutritional causes.\n\n\n3.2.3 Interactive Distribution between Age, Region, Gender and Death Cause Groups\n\n\nCode\ndf_2_long_2019&lt;-df_2_long %&gt;%\n  filter(year == 2019)%&gt;%\n  filter(level == 1)\n\ndf_2_long_2019$region &lt;-factor(df_2_long_2019$region, levels = c('Afr','Emr',\"Sear\",'Amr',\"Wpr\",\"Eur\"))\ndf_2_long_2019$age_group &lt;- as.factor(df_2_long_2019$age_group)\ndf_2_long_2019$sex &lt;- as.factor(df_2_long_2019$sex)\n\ndf_2_long_2019 &lt;- df_2_long_2019 %&gt;%\n  mutate(age_group2 = case_when(\n    age_group %in% c(\"0-28 days\", \"1-59 months\", \"5-14 years\") ~ \"&lt;15\",\n    age_group %in% c(\"30-49 years\", \"15-29 years\") ~ \"15-49\",\n    age_group %in% c(\"50-59 years\", \"60-69 years\") ~ \"50-69\",\n    TRUE ~ \"70+\"\n  ))\ndf_2_long_2019$cause &lt;-factor(df_2_long_2019$cause, levels = c(\"Communicable & Nutritional\",\"Noncommunicable\",\"Injuries\"))\n\ncolnames(df_2_long_2019)[colnames(df_2_long_2019) == \"death_num\"] &lt;- \"Freq\"\n\nmosaic(age_group2~region,data=df_2_long_2019,highlighting_fill=c(\"#F1F1F1\",\"#A7C6DD\",\"#7C7BB2\",\"#6B0077\"),direction=c('v','h'))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following analysis of the 2019 data analyzes whether there is an interaction relationship between the number of deaths in different regions, ages, and sexes.\nFirst note that the age composition of deaths is characterized differently across region. Afr and Emr have more young people in their death cohorts. Especially for Afr, the number of deaths under 15 accounts for almost half of the overall number of deaths, which may be related to the health care conditions in the region. For Amr, Wpr and Eur, on the other hand, the age group over 69 accounted for the majority of the overall number of deaths.\n\n\nCode\nmosaic(age_group2 ~ cause,\n       data = df_2_long_2019,\n       highlighting_fill = c(\"#F1F1F1\", \"#A7C6DD\",\"#7C7BB2\", \"#6B0077\"),\n       direction = c('v', 'h'),\n       rot_labels = c(0,0,0,90),\n       fontsize=2)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also noted that the age distribution within the groups of people who died due to different causes varies. The adolescent group accounts for a larger proportion of deaths due to infectious diseases and malnutrition, while the 70+ age group accounts for a larger proportion of deaths due to noncommunicable diseases. Deaths from accidental injuries and deaths are almost evenly distributed across age groups.\n\n\nCode\nmosaic(sex~age_group2,data=df_2_long_2019,highlighting_fill=c(\"#A7C6DD\",\"#6B0077\"),direction=c('v','h','h'))\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmosaic(sex~region,data=df_2_long_2019,highlighting_fill=c(\"#A7C6DD\",\"#6B0077\"),direction=c('v','h'))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gender distribution is almost even across age and regional divisions.\n\n\n3.2.4 Comparison of the Distribution of Causes of Death by Region - Analysis of Similarities and Differences\nFinally, we will analyze the similarity of the distribution of causes of death in different geographic areas, with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method.\n\n\nCode\ndf_2_long_filtered &lt;- df_2_long %&gt;%\n  filter(level == 1)%&gt;%\n  filter( year == 2019 )%&gt;%\n  mutate(age_group2 = case_when(\n    age_group %in% c(\"0-28 days\", \"1-59 months\", \"5-14 years\", \"15-29 years\") ~ \"&lt;30 years\",\n    age_group %in% c(\"30-49 years\") ~ \"30-49 years\",\n    age_group %in% c(\"50-59 years\", \"60-69 years\") ~ \"50-69 years\",\n    TRUE ~ \"70+ years\"\n  ))\n\ndf_2_long_filtered &lt;- df_2_long_filtered %&gt;%\n  select(-age_group)%&gt;%\n  select(-sex)%&gt;%\n  select(-age_group2)\n\ndf_2_long_filtered$region &lt;- paste(df_2_long_filtered$region, df_2_long_filtered$year, sep = \"_\")\ndf_2_long_filtered &lt;- df_2_long_filtered %&gt;%\n  select(- year)\n\ndf_2_long_filtered &lt;- df_2_long_filtered %&gt;%\n  group_by(cause,region) %&gt;%\n  summarise(death_num = sum(death_num))\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'cause'.

Notice that the distributions for Eur, Amr, and Emr remain relatively similar, and that Emr and Amr show the same changing trends, i.e., an increase in the share of deaths from noncommunicable diseases and a decrease in deaths from communicable. For Afr, Sear and Wpr, despite the very different characteristics of the causes of death, they show the same trend of change from 2000 to 2019 (same direction of movement for all three points). They all had a decrease in the share of deaths due to communicable & nutritional reasons, and an increase in the share of noncommunicable diseases."

You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nCode\n# Order regions by increasing average death rate\nordered_regions &lt;- death_rate_agg %&gt;%\n  group_by(Location) %&gt;%\n  summarise(AvgDeathRate = mean(AverageDeathRate)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(AvgDeathRate) %&gt;%\n  pull(Location)\n\n# Bar chart for death rate of each region over years\nggplot(death_rate_agg, aes(x = Year, y = AverageDeathRate, fill = reorder(Location, AverageDeathRate))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge') +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Paired\") + \n  labs(title = \"Death Rate of Each Region Over Years\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Average Death Rate\",\n       fill = \"Region\") \n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2000, death rate ranks from low to high as Americas (0.021), Europe, Western Pacific, Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and Africa (0.041), and the average difference between regions is 0.001. While in 2019, the rank from low to high becomes Americas (0.019), Europe, Western Pacific, South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, and Africa (0.031). The gap between regions also becomes smaller, espacially Americas and Europe (almost the same).\nOne noticeable thing is that South-East Asia’s death rate drops greater than Eastern Mediterranean, and became the 4th rank since 2010. This also corresponds with the rapid economic and social development of South-East Asia in the past decades.\nComparing the change in death rate, we observe that Africa has the greatest decrease in death rate about 0.01, while Americas has the smallest decrease in death rate about 0.002, which is 1/5 of Africa’s death rate change.\nGlobally, death rate presents a consistent decreasing trend from 2000 to 2019, and drops from 0.029 to 0.021 by 0.008. Americas, Europe, Western Pacific have death rates lower than the global level, while South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, and Africa have death rates higher than the global level.\n\n\nCode\n# Aggregate life expectancy in each year\nlife_exp_birth &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(Indicator == 'life_exp_age' & Age == '&lt;1 year') %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year, Location) %&gt;%\n  summarise(AvgLifeExpBirth = mean(Value))\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Year'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nCode\n# Order in ascending order\nordered_regions &lt;- life_exp_birth %&gt;%\n  group_by(Location) %&gt;%\n  summarise(AvgLifeExpBirth = mean(AvgLifeExpBirth)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(AvgLifeExpBirth) %&gt;%\n  pull(Location)\n\n# Bar chart for life expectancy of each region over years\nggplot(life_exp_birth, aes(x = Year, y = AvgLifeExpBirth, fill = reorder(Location, AvgLifeExpBirth))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge') +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Paired\") +\n  labs(title = \"Life Expectancy of Each Region Over Years\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Average Life Expectancy at Birth\",\n       fill = \"Region\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to death rate, differences in life expectancy across region is smaller. In 2000, the rank of life expectancy from low to high is Africa (52), South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, Western Pacific, Europe, and Americas (72). While in 2019, the rank became Africa (63), Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, Americas, Western Pacific, and Europe (79).\nLife expectancy of South-East Asia caught up and surpassed that of Eastern Mediterranean since 2005, while life expectancy of Americas fell behind Western Pacific and Europe since 2010. This can be explained by the rapid development of South-East Asia and problems such as obesity in Americas.\nLooking at change rates, Africa’s life expectancy increase by 20 in the past 20 years, which is the biggest among all regions. Americas’ life expectancy rises by 6. Eastern Mediterranean’s life expectancy only rises by 2, which is the smallest change among all regions.\nGlobally, life expectancy keeps rising over years, and rose from 66 to 72. Americas, Europe, Western Pacific have life expectancy higher than the global level, while South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, and Africa have life expectancy lower than the global level.\nAccording to the 2 side-by-side bar charts above, we can observe a general decreasing death rate and increasing life expectancy from 2000 to 2019. The change of developed regions, such as Americas and Europe is smaller than developing regions such as Africa and South-East Asia. This shows that economic and social developments bring more improvements in people’s well being to less-developed regions, especially Africa.\n\n\n3.1.2 Effect of Sex on Death Rate and Life Expectancy\nThen we will look at whether death rate and life expectancy differ by sex globally and regionally.\n\n\nCode\nregion_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(Location != '(WHO) Global')\n\nglobal_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(Location == '(WHO) Global')\n\nggplot(global_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge') +\n  facet_wrap(~Indicator, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Set2\") +\n  labs(title = \"Comparison of Death Rate and Life Expectancy by Sex Over Years\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Value\",\n       fill = \"Sex\")\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, we can observe that death rate of male is higher than that of female, and in turn, life expectancy of male is smaller than that of female. The differences of death rate and life expectancy between two genders remains generally constant, without significant variations over time. On average, male death rate is 0.004 higher than female, and male life expectancy is 4-5 lower than female.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(region_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge') +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(Indicator), cols = vars(Location), scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Set2\") +\n  labs(title = \"Comparison of Death Rate and Life Expectancy by Sex and Region Over Years\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Value\",\n       fill = \"Sex\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size =12),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 8),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 8),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size=6,hjust=1),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 6),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 6))\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen faceting by regions, we can observe some patterns here. Western Pacific has the greatest difference in death rate between male and female, and the big difference persists over time. Eastern Mediterranean has the smallest gap in death rate between male and female, and the gap gets smaller from 2000 to 2019. Looking at life expectancy, Europe has the biggest gap between genders, with the gap becomes smaller over time, and South-East Asia has the smallest gap.\nTo sum up, male has higher death rate and lower life expectancy than women. The effect has the same direction in each region, but the magnitude is different. Also the effect does not appear to change significantly over time.\n\n\n3.1.3 Death Rate Over Age Groups\nFurther, we are interested in the distribution of death rate over age groups.\n\n\nCode\ndeath_rate_global &lt;- global_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Indicator == 'death_rate_age')\n\n# Order age groups\nage_order &lt;- c(\"&lt;1 year\", \"1-4 years\", \"5-9 years\", \"10-14 years\", \"15-19 years\", \n               \"20-24 years\", \"25-29 years\", \"30-34 years\", \"35-39 years\", \n               \"40-44 years\", \"45-49 years\", \"50-54 years\", \"55-59 years\", \n               \"60-64 years\", \"65-69 years\", \"70-74 years\", \"75-79 years\", \n               \"80-84 years\", \"85+ years\")\n\n# Order in dataset\ndeath_rate_global$Age &lt;- factor(death_rate_global$Age, levels = age_order)\n\n# Plot with the specified order\nggplot(death_rate_global, aes(x = Age, y = Value)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge', color = 'blue', fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Death Rate by Age Group\",\n       x = \"Age Group\",\n       y = \"Death Rate\") +\n  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size=8, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the global trend, death rate increases with age after 4-year-old. This is reasonable since infants are more vulnerable to disease, which results in a high death rate of 0.055. After the infant stage, death rate increases with age from 0.001 at 5-9 years to 0.21 at 85+ years. As human grow up, we have more interactions with the world, leading to higher risk of accidents; our cells get damaged by injury, stress, and DNA mutations, leading to higher risk of disease. Therefore, death rate rises continuously.\n\n\nCode\ndeath_rate_region &lt;- region_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Indicator == 'death_rate_age')\n\ndeath_rate_region$Age &lt;- factor(death_rate_region$Age, levels = age_order)\n\nggplot(death_rate_region, aes(x = Age, y = Value)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'dodge', color = 'blue', fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Death Rate by Age Group\",\n       x = \"Age Group\",\n       y = \"Death Rate\") +\n  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5),\n          axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size=8,hjust=1))+\n  facet_wrap(~ Location)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we facet by region, we observe different death rate patterns. First of all, infant mortality (death rate of &lt;1 year group) is high in Africa (0.11), South-East Asia (0.07), and Eastern Mediterranean (0.07), while infant mortality is low in Americas, Europe, and Western Pacific, which is around 0.025. Second, death rate of 85+ group of Americas and Europe (&lt;0.2) is lower than that of South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean (around 0.2), and death rate of 85+ group of Africa and Western Pacific is the higher, around 0.25.\nThe difference in infant mortality can be explained by health care infrastructure and medical practices. In Africa, maternity care might be not established, and new-born babies also lack of medical care, leading to high death rate of the &lt;1 year group. While in developed regions, pregnant women and infants are more likely to receive proper health care, leading to lower death rate.\nOverall, death rate is closely related to the establishment of the health care system. So it is reasonable that death rate in developing regions is higher than that of developed regions."

    "text": "We have utilized the data provided by Global Health Estimates (GHE), and the main findings include:\nFirst, in the overall changes in death rate and life expectancy over time, all regions are experiencing a decline in mortality and an increase in life expectancy, implying an improvement in global healthcare. Noting the overall upward trend in the number of deaths does not contradict the above findings, as mortality is a quotient of the number of deaths to the overall population. In terms of gender differences, males have higher death rates and shorter life expectancy than females. In terms of age-group differences, death rates are higher among newborns and the elderly, and the relationship between mortality and age is U-shaped.\nSecond, in the analysis of the causes of death, the number of deaths from noncommunicable diseases is on the rise, while the number of deaths from communicable and malnutrition diseases is on the decline, and the number of deaths from injuries is basically unchanged over time. By region, the trends in the proportion of causes of death vary from region to region. In Africa and Southeast Asia, the proportion of deaths due to infectious and malnutritional diseases is higher, but shows a decreasing trend over time; in the Americas, Europe, and the Western Pacific Region, the proportion of deaths due to non-communicable types of diseases is higher and shows an increasing trend. In terms of specific disease classification, among noncommunicable diseases, Cardiovascular diseases, Malignant neoplasms and Respiratory diseases are the top 3 causes for death. Among communicable & nutritional reasons, Infectious and parasitic diseases, Neonatal conditions and Respiratory Infectious are the top 3 causes for death. And for injuries, unintentional injuries account for a higher proportion of deaths than intentional injuries.\nThird, in analysis of the interactive distribution of categorical variables for the static data in 2019, it was found that the proportion of age groups of deaths varied from region to region, and the more economically developed the region was, the lower the proportion of young people in the population of deaths, and the higher the proportion of old people. In the age distribution of different causes of death, it is found that the proportion of younger groups is higher in the population of deaths from communicable diseases, while the proportion of older people is significantly higher in the population of deaths from non communicable diseases. ; while for the death population from injuries, there is no very significant age difference.\nFinally, we analyzed the differences and similarities in the distribution of causes of death in each region with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The results showed that the distribution of causes of death is more similar in Europe, the Americas, and the Eastern Mediterranean Region, whereas the African Region has more deaths due to communicable and nutritional diseases, the Western Pacific Region has more deaths due to noncommunicable diseases and South-East Asia Region has more deaths due to injuries.\nIn conclusion, the findings derived from the analysis of Global Health Estimates (GHE) data paint a comprehensive picture of the evolving landscape of global health. The observed decline in mortality rates and simultaneous increase in life expectancy across all regions signify a positive trajectory in global healthcare. While acknowledging the persistent challenges reflected in the overall upward trend in the number of deaths, it is crucial to recognize that mortality is intricately linked to population dynamics.\nLooking ahead, these insights can inform future healthcare policies and interventions. Addressing gender-specific health challenges, tailoring strategies for different age groups, and region-specific health initiatives are imperative. The identification of prevalent causes of death provides a roadmap for prioritizing resources and research efforts. As we navigate the complexities of global health, this research contributes to evidence-based decision-making and collaborative international efforts, laying the groundwork for a healthier future."
