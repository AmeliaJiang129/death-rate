# Conclusion

We have utilized the data provided by Global Health Estimates (GHE), and the main findings include:

First, in the overall changes in death rate and life expectancy over time, all regions are experiencing a decline in mortality and an increase in life expectancy, implying an improvement in global healthcare. Noting the overall upward trend in the number of deaths does not contradict the above findings, as mortality is a quotient of the number of deaths to the overall population. In terms of gender differences, males have higher death rates and shorter life expectancy than females. In terms of age-group differences, death rates are higher among newborns and the elderly, and the relationship between mortality and age is U-shaped.

Second, in the analysis of the causes of death, the number of deaths from noncommunicable diseases is on the rise, while the number of deaths from communicable and malnutrition diseases is on the decline, and the number of deaths from injuries is basically unchanged over time. By region, the trends in the proportion of causes of death vary from region to region. In Africa and Southeast Asia, the proportion of deaths due to infectious and malnutritional diseases is higher, but shows a decreasing trend over time; in the Americas, Europe, and the Western Pacific Region, the proportion of deaths due to non-communicable types of diseases is higher and shows an increasing trend. In terms of specific disease classification, among noncommunicable diseases, Cardiovascular diseases, Malignant neoplasms and Respiratory diseases are the top 3 causes for death. Among communicable & nutritional reasons, Infectious and parasitic diseases, Neonatal conditions and Respiratory Infectious are the top 3 causes for death. And for injuries, unintentional injuries account for a higher proportion of deaths than intentional injuries.

Third, in analysis of the interactive distribution of categorical variables for the static data in 2019, it was found that the proportion of age groups of deaths varied from region to region, and the more economically developed the region was, the lower the proportion of young people in the population of deaths, and the higher the proportion of old people. In the age distribution of different causes of death, it is found that the proportion of younger groups is higher in the population of deaths from communicable diseases, while the proportion of older people is significantly higher in the population of deaths from non communicable diseases. ; while for the death population from injuries, there is no very significant age difference.

Finally, we analyzed the differences and similarities in the distribution of causes of death in each region with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The results showed that the distribution of causes of death is more similar in Europe, the Americas, and the Eastern Mediterranean Region, whereas the African Region has more deaths due to communicable and nutritional diseases, the Western Pacific Region has more deaths due to noncommunicable diseases and South-East Asia Region has more deaths due to injuries.

In conclusion, the findings derived from the analysis of Global Health Estimates (GHE) data paint a comprehensive picture of the evolving landscape of global health. The observed decline in mortality rates and simultaneous increase in life expectancy across all regions signify a positive trajectory in global healthcare. While acknowledging the persistent challenges reflected in the overall upward trend in the number of deaths, it is crucial to recognize that mortality is intricately linked to population dynamics.

Looking ahead, these insights can inform future healthcare policies and interventions. Addressing gender-specific health challenges, tailoring strategies for different age groups, and region-specific health initiatives are imperative. The identification of prevalent causes of death provides a roadmap for prioritizing resources and research efforts. As we navigate the complexities of global health, this research contributes to evidence-based decision-making and collaborative international efforts, laying the groundwork for a healthier future.
